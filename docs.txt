1. Task:

Test task for Server Engineer

Design and implement “Word of Wisdom” tcp server.
 • TCP server should be protected from DDOS attacks with the Proof of Work (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), the challenge-response protocol should be used.
 • The choice of the POW algorithm should be explained.
 • After Proof Of Work verification, server should send one of the quotes from “word of wisdom” book or any other collection of the quotes.
 • Docker file should be provided both for the server and for the client that solves the POW challenge

2. POW algorithm selection:
DDoS POW algorithm demands:
    - CPU calculation. (May have clients with low hardware, without GPU, etc.)
    - Fast for single (small amount) queries - should not decrease TTFB.
    - Reduced time for researching (Need to chose after 1h search).

Results: Due to lack of knowledge and time limitation, I selected SHA256 calculation cause it used in common projects.
Assume that necessary researches already has been made, and it was selected as the best.
TODO (KB): Additional researches for alternative algorithms.
