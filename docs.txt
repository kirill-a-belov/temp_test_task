1. Task:

Test task for Server Engineer

Design and implement “Word of Wisdom” tcp server.
 • TCP server should be protected from DDOS attacks with the Proof of Work (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), the challenge-response protocol should be used.
 • The choice of the POW algorithm should be explained.
 • After Proof Of Work verification, server should send one of the quotes from “word of wisdom” book or any other collection of the quotes.
 • Docker file should be provided both for the server and for the client that solves the POW challenge

2. POW algorithm selection:
DDoS POW algorithm demands:
    - CPU calculation. (May have clients with low hardware, without GPU, etc.)
    - Fast for single (small amount) queries - should not decrease TTFB.
    - Reduced time for researching (Need to chose after 1h search).

Results: Due to lack of knowledge and time limitation, I selected SHA256 calculation cause it used in common projects.
Assume that necessary researches already has been made, and it was selected as the best.
TODO (KB): Additional researches for alternative algorithms.

Open problems:
1. Large botnet can cause computing or/and network large consumption even before POW checking.
    Solutions:
    1.1 Use 3-d party DDOS protection (e.g. Cloudflare)
    1.2 Use local rate limiting
2. Dummy client can be created, sending random nonce w/o real calculation. Computing resources for handling a single
connection for client < for server => client can DDOS server.
    Solutions:
    1. Limited prefix pool (instead of generated) + prefix-nonce cache layer. (TBD, depends on difficulty)
    2. ???

Improvements:
0. Test coverage
1. Network ops abstraction. (e.g. using generics, messages unification, etc.)
2. Durability benchmarks
